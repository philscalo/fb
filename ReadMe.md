# Fizzbuzz in Python!

This is your opportunity to do fizz buzz... again! But in python!

We want to take this morning lesson and have you try and learn another programming language by doing a problem you're already familiar with.

## The rules:
- have your application print the numbers 1-100 in the console
- if the number is a multiple of `3` then replace the number with `fizz`
- if the number is a multiple of `5` then replace the number with `buzz`
- if the number is a multiple of both replace the number with `fizzbuzz`

## Bonus 1

Use only 4 z's in your answer!
Variables count as using z's. So don't use variable to circumvent this bonus.

## Bonus 2

Solve this without any loops (recursion)


## Bonus 3

Solve this with classes and objects
